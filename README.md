# chat-frontend

Load the index.html file, and it should be working.
This repo is published on github pages but it does not work due to mixed content (github pages is on https and the server is on http).

One known issue: on iOS Safari when the keyboard is up, the top of the chat messages is not visible so the first few messages are cut from the viewport.
